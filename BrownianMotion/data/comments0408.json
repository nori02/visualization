It describes how these financial products are very similar to the adjustable rate mortgages sold to consumers, with skyrocketing interest rates when the economy declines.<br /><br />Tax-exempt municipal bonds have always been considered a safe way to both invest money for consumers and to raise money for cities.

However, when the rating of the bond insurer declined, the interest rate rose dramatically.<br /><br />I only understand the vague outline of this process, but the municipalities have clearly been deceived about the possible downside of the process.

The writer does not ask or tell what happens when such an insurer downgrade occurs with respect to a \"conservative and dependable\" fixed rate bond. Does it precipitate an event of default, an acceleration, surely the bond indenture must require some cure?<br /><br />The writer notes that \"On a page titled \u201cInterest Rate Swap Risks\u201d for example, there is no mention of the consequences of a downgrade in the bond insurer\u2019s rating.\" Why should there be?  The downgrade of the bond insurer is not a risk specific to the swap, rather to the bond.<br /><br />The writer states that \"A swap allowed a municipality to keep a portion of its debt at a fixed interest rate and a portion at a variable rate. The municipality was, in effect, betting that interest rates would move in its favor.\"  How so?  With a mix of both fixed and variable debt -- a widely used and approved strategy in finance -- the municipality was actually reducing its exposure to a singular bet on the future direction of interest rates either up or down.<br /><br />The writer avers that \"An investment bank makes more in fees and annual income from derivatives than from fixed-rate bonds\" without providing any substantiating facts to support this contention.<br /><br />The writer states that \"Municipalities that bought the derivatives were like homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages who refinanced by taking out lower-interest, variable-rate mortgages.\"  Huh?

Lewisburg had high interest bonds 5 years ago that it was struggling to service. The fact that it was unable to refinance in the low rate environment that prevailed then suggests that either its credit was shot or it had simply borrowed more than it's tax income could service.<br /><br />2.

They played the roles of doctors who recommended  treatment that was not a cure, the doctors who administered that treatment, and the doctors who profited from their malpractice while the patient not only did not get better but became much more ill.  We prosecute doctors for medical malpractice.  Commenter #9 mentions a regulatory agency that has apparently been asleep for some time.  We must prosecute financial advisers who engage in this kind of financial malpractice. A host of investment firms, small and large, who engaged in financial malpractice in our current economic crisis should be on the docket nationwide, keeping the civil courts busy for a very, very long time.<br /><br />Secondly, remarks made by commenter #1 ring true.  We made a serious mistake when we granted corporations the same status as individuals in the court system.  It is patently unfair to allow organized groups of people to pool their resources to buy almost unlimited high priced legal defense, to duck liability because no one individual can be held responsible for the practices of the corporation as a whole, and to engage in practices as a group that would land an individual in jail without question.  Consider another analogy  credit is an addictive drug. Various financial entities were pushing it to the American people.  We haul drug dealers off to jail for peddling addictive substances and conduct a war on drugs.  Why are we not hauling these dealers of poisonous credit off to jail and conducting a war on the organizations that were peddling these toxic products?  It is time to stop privileging white collar crime committed by groups of people in high priced suits.<br /><br />Third, Americans as a whole are woefully financially ignorant, and this makes us easy marks for various financial entities such as Morgan Keegan and credit card companies who engage in such practices as this article describes.  As commenter #7 notes, these financial entities also are able to wield considerable influence and protect themselves by \"buying off\" our politicians, again putting them at distinct advantage in comparison to individual citizens and the common good.  High schools should make personal finance courses graduation requirements, and universities should make basic investment finance courses graduation requirements.  If we were better educated about money management and able to recognize deals that are too good to be true for what they are, we would be much less likely to be complicit in the poor decision making that has finally landed us at the bottom of a well of personal, municipal, state, and federal debt.<br /><br />We can climb out of the well, but we've got to vigorously prosecute existing laws and enact more rigorous regulations governing our so called free markets.  The Constitution gives individuals various basic individual rights, but all of these rights have corresponding responsibilities. The right to a free market also has responsibilities attached to it. Those responsibilities have been jettisoned by many financial players for a very long time, and our government has turned a blind eye to their irresponsibility until now, when these irresponsible practices threaten to collapse the market.  As a nation, we should not be distracted by those who wave the free market flag to defend their destructive practices.  What they really want is financial anarchy that allows them to do whatever they want if it brings them immediate profit, no matter how socially irresponsible.

The US cannot force western ways on any country and having gay marriages in any state or country won't force acceptance of the gay lifestyle.<br /><br />What's required is not acceptance, but tolerance.  These are two very different things.  There may be parts of US culture that I don't accept (a commitment to consumption as a lifestyle, for example), but I tolerate.  As far as the gay issue goes, the only reason people ever have for rejecting it is religious.<br /><br />As a free society, the US has no basis for discriminating against gays and lesbians.  If one wants to completely avoid gays and lesbians, one an join a religious community and live a sheltered lifestyle.  The priesthood comes to mind, then I am reminded of the rampant homosexuality within that community.  S perhaps there is no escape, other than a personal choice to live in constant fear and hatred of a character difference that has existed throughout time, across cultures and even across species.<br /><br />The problem I find with Iraq is that my tax dollars are going to support a regime that openly promotes killing of a certain class of people.  Take away the gay issue - say we substitute handicapped or blind.  Think about it - even if you are against gay-ism, would you want your tax dollars supporting a regime that suggests killing blind people?  I know, you will say blind people don't have a choice and gay people do.  Yes, that is why all the people in this article are gay, they are choosing to be hated, chased and killed!<br /><br />The only solution to this situation is the same as in any other where a minority is discriminated against, strict legislation guaranteeing equal rights.  President Obama needs to take a lead on this by instantly guaranteeing the rights of gays and lesbians so we are treated EXACTLY the same as every other citizen of the US.  Currently there are over 1100 Federal Laws that discriminate (starting with that silly don't ask - don't tell and move on up the line to immigration rights for gay and lesbian couples who can't be together despite their longstanding love for each other).<br /><br />Make all foreign AID subject to the countries that are receiving it subject to a basic human rights code which includes non-discrimination.  Other countries don't have top play by our human rights rules, but if they want my hard earned cash, they do.<br /><br />One only has to look at history to know that full freedom for gays is coming.  Europe started it - even South Africa now has gay marriage.  The US is highly religious, yet supposedly secular.  The only way to move forward on this issue is to define 2 types of marriage - a secular form and a religious form.  If an individual religion chooses not to honor gay marriage, fine.  The state needs to have it's own secular version of marriage because it bestows rights and benefits to that status.  There are many heterosexual agnostics and atheists who are married.  They have no commitment to anything but each other.  God and bible are not involved.  they receive many benefits that a similar gay couple is not entitled to.<br /><br />We must lead by example.

But if we have such an open society, then why do so many gays, even now, live in the closet?

Why is it that in our 'enlightened' US that in 35 states people can be fired simply for being gay, or denied housing or medical assistance? Why is it that even here in NYC, supposedly the heart of toleration, that has huge  gay pride events, the city and state government offering all kinds of laws, that gay bashing goes on and in more then a few cases is basically ignored by the cops (not surprising, considering that the NYC PD still has a lot of Italian and Irish Catholics, who have been taught by their church to see gays as second class human beings).<br /><br />And for those who decry Islam for its homophobia, take a look at Christianity, at the Catholic Church with its billion members and the evangelical hate mongers, are they are better?

It is about being raised in an environment of us versus them, of 'my group is better then yours', and it exists in the west as well as Iraq.<br /><br />As far as the US government doing something to protect gays, I wouldn't hold my breath.The US military isn't exactly full of enlightened, tolerant types, most of them come from backgrounds where homophobia is assumed and if they had their way, they probably would kill gays if they could get away with it.

It gives engineers and investors a taget to shoot for. If CO2 is taxed at $15/t and you can remove it for $10/t then you have a viable business model. With cap and trade there is huge uncertainty as to what the emissions credits will be worth. The European experience with that system has been that prices have been very volatile. Uncertainty and volatility are very bad for investment.<br /><br />Message <br /><br />The story of the past ten years has been one of failing to get out in front of potential problems before they blow up. In the late 90s we knew that Al-Qaeda was cooking up trouble but going to Afghanistan to destroy them was thought to be too much trouble. Then 9/11 happened. In the early 00s there were several articles about the vulnerability of New Orleans to a major hurricane, but nothing was done to improve flood defenses. Then Katrina happened. By 2005 there was much discussion of a housing bubble on the net and some articles in the press. The government could have cracked down on mortgage fraud and could have strenghtened financial regulation. Unfortunately people like Alan Greenspan denied there was a problem and nothing was done. Then Bear Stearns, Fannie, Freddy, Lehman and AIG happened and the credit crunch hit.<br /><br />With climate change, let's try to get out in front of the problem rather than waiting for disaster!", "created": "1239169490", "user": "schrodinger", "location": "Northern California"}, {"text": "Thomas Friedman's article \"Show Us the Ball\" address only the political element involved in passing a carbon tax.  A carbon tax is necessary and the American public needs to come to grips with that.  However, Friedman is wrong on all counts.  The reasons for using a cap and trade system are manifold.  First of all it is very difficult for the government to appropriately price emissions.  It is a near certainty that any tax on carbon set by the government will be woefully inadequate.  Congress will almost always wish to err on the side of lessening the burden on the tax payer which will mean that the desired effect of promoting ET will be insufficient.  Markets are very good at pricing things.  They quickly incorporate all information into the price and correct themselves when some of that information turns out to be misinformation.  Using a cap and trade system will set the correct price as long as our politicians have the guts to set the cap correctly.<br /><br />Friedman's second point that the tax should be sold as American renewal has some salience.  However, many of us recognize that there are significant risks to our planet from continued emissions of greenhouse gases and if we do not set the price of emissions correctly American renewal will become just another hollow slogan. It is desirable to use all the motivating factors that have force.  We must make significant investments in technologies that will allow us to reduce the risks of climate change, however, the technologies are the means and the risk reduction is the goal.<br /><br />As far as Friedman's third suggestion I think we should all give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he was joking.", "created": "1239179741", "user": "Richard Weldon", "location": "Denver, CO"}, {"text": "I am in Bonn, Germany as an \"observer\" to the UN climate change negotiations which conclude today.  I am in agreement with the major message of your column, but I do not agree that addressing climate change can only be \"sold\" to the American people as a pathway to a new green economy or as a national security matter -- though those points are quite true merit trumpeting.<br /><br />The science being relied upon by developed and developing nations alike can be summarized as   (1) in order to avert dangerous climate change we need to avoid temperature rise above 2 degrees Celsius (approximately 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit, (2) which necessitates keeping C02 equivalents in the atmosphere to no higher than 450 ppm, (3) if we fail to alter the world's business as usual carbon pathway we will reach 450 ppm in approximately 2050 and (4) the consequences of a temperature rise of between 2-3 degrees Celsius would include extinction of 30 percent of our species, the loss of the Amazon rain forest, greatly increased extreme weather events, drought, great transmittal of dangerous pest borne diseases, over one billion people with inadequate fresh water to live, an ecologically impaired ocean -- the list goes on and on.  Indeed, the focus of the scientific debate here in Bonn has been whether 450 ppm is sufficiently protective in view of emerging scientific evidence of negative environmental feedbacks (e.g., the very recent evidence of unexpectedly strong warming in Antarctica) -- many take the position it needs to be substantially lower.  This seems to me a perfectly rational concern, particularly when the 450 ppm goal is calculated to give the world a 50-50 chance of not exceeding 2 degrees warming -- the severe negative consequences of passing the 450 ppm threshold is not something I personally would feel terribly secure flipping a coin over.<br /><br />What to do?  The true leaders of the world must get personally involved to ensure that a strong, equitable, scientifically driven climate deal mapping a low carbon future is signed in Copenhagen.  (Here in the United States, politicians must also be true leaders and resist the temptation to play climate change as a political issue \u2013 there is simply far too much at stake.)  Additionally, we must employ those fast action strategies that can be used in the immediate future with nearly immediate climate benefits such as greatly reducing black carbon (e.g., soot from diesel engines in vehicles, vessels, heavy equipment, etc.), quickly phasing out non-CO2 global warming gases such as HFCs for which we have immediate technologies and strategies, and taking rapid steps to stop global deforestation (currently contributing around 18% of GHG emissions).  While it will take a great, united effort, the opportunity to avert the most dangerous aspects of climate change are in our hands.<br /><br />So yes, let's call a tax a tax, let's employ our most motivational spokesmen to move the country in the right direction, but let's also make absolutely sure that the American people know what is at stake here   it's not \"maybe,\" it's certainly not trivial (though, granted, the world's poor will suffer even more mightily than we in the U.S.) and it is not at all that far off   there is a reason many of the young here in Bonn wear a T-shirt say \"How old will you be in 2050?\"<br />", "created": "1239180021", "user": "Pete", "location": "Silver Spring, MD"}, {"text": "Why not Cap and Dividend?<br /><br />It addresses just about every concern voiced here by Friedman and the commenters (except, of course, those who doubt the problem exists).<br /><br />It sets a reduction goal.<br /><br />It is simpler than Cap and Trade, and it's fairer than Tax and Refund.

There is certainly the possibility that some administrative tinkering did take place during the elections, the possibility, i say, but it is not yet an established fact. But, my dear friends, this does not give anyone the slighest right to turn the centre of Chisinau into a flaming pigsty, to wreak juvenile havoc on Parliament and to portray themselves as an infantile mob of un-civilized thugs that imagine themselves to be freedom-fighters.<br /><br />There are issues to resolve, but their resolution has to proceed along well-trodden Western paths of calculated, civilised and respectful engagement with one's political opponents. Instead of seating themselves at the negotiation table these people chose to  a) Stand on the said table and shout horrid obscenities while devouring a fierce amount of alcohol, b) Subsequently proceed to throw this said table out of the Parliament's windows, and c) To set fire to the remaining tables, and all other furniture present in the Parliament.<br /><br />The \"heroes\" of this article are the \"wizz-kids\" of the New Age of the Almighty Internet, but it seems to me that these so-called \"national leaders of the Moldovan youth movement\" lack political maturity, accuracy of judgement and need a good dose of common sense to restrain their revolutionary urges which no doubt arise from the steady influx of Spring sexual hormones into their nationalist heads. You cannot, i repeat, you cannot bring a crowd of thousands into the streets having pepped them up beforehand with a generous dose of intolerant, violent and abusive propaganda, and expect them to light candles, sing the national anthem and quietly disperse. It is nothing but a sign of political cowardice to disclaim responsibility for the results of a protest instigated by oneself.<br /><br />Though i support many of the aspirations of the Moldovan youth, i refuse to be associated with the disgrace that took place between 6-7 April on the streets of my home town.

Recently a Romanian businessman, Gigi Becali, was arrested on the charge of kidnapping the criminals who stole his car. His bodyguards tracked the perpetrators, and in a bold commando raid rammed their car, forced them in the trunk of an SUV, and transported them to Becali which had a talk with them about not stealing cars in the future. The scene was broadcast widely on Romanian TV and the identities of the car thieves are known, however it is Gigi Becali who is in prison for kidnapping, and not the car thieves for grand theft auto! According to widespread Romanian press reports, the thieves are part of a crime syndicate headed by the notorious criminal Sandu Geamanu whose resume includes killing a 2 year old girl with a ninja sword. He too is a free man because of deals he made with the Romanian justice system to set up Becali for a fall. Corrupt Romanian prosecutors did not put him in jail for killing a 2 year old girl with a ninja sword, invoking the argument that \"he does not present a public risk\"! As incredible as this may seem, unfortunately it is very true.<br /><br />Gigi Becali is being targeted because he made public details of a corrupt business deal which implicates a Romanian-American businessman, high level Romanian government officials, and the US embassy in Bucharest. Becali himself was involved in widely known corrupt business deals but the justice system is not going after him on those charges because doing so will automatically implicate high level army and government officials which would also have to take the fall. So instead, the so called justice system is using this grand theft auto episode to arrest the victim of the car theft and not the actual thieves.<br /><br />This is communism at its finest and unfortunately is a very real plague which is preventing Romania from moving away from its communist past.<br /><br /><a href=\"http //dangiurca.4t.com\" target=\"_blank\">dangiurca.4t.com</a><br />", "created": "1239178765", "user": "Dan Giurca", "location": "New York"}, {"text": "Welcome to the 21st Century, world leaders and your underlings!<br /><br />The Internet has brought MANY benefits to our lives, but I think one of the less well realised by those in power is its ability to allow ordinary citizens to communicate their disatisfaction with laws and actions made by governments without public consent.<br /><br />China's leadership is running scared - they don't yet truly understand what they've got themselves into, and even mainstream country leaders from places like the USA, UK and Australia are discovering that that it's harder and harder to hide in the shadows and do things they wouldn't normally like their voting citizens to know about.<br /><br />Good on the Moldovian citizens for taking action!

The protests are a legitimate attempt to break away from communist influence.<br /><br />At the same time however, protests should be taking place in Bucharest to address the neo-communist justice system which is still very much in control. Recently a Romanian businessman, Gigi Becali, was arrested on the charge of kidnapping the criminals who stole his car. His bodyguards tracked the perpetrators and in a bold commando raid rammed their car, forced them in the trunk of an SUV, and transported them to Becali who had a talk with them about not stealing cars in the future. The scene was broadcast widely on Romanian TV and the identities of the car thieves are known to the police, however it is Gigi Becali who is in prison for kidnapping, and not the car thieves for grand theft auto! According to widespread Romanian press reports, the thieves are part of a crime syndicate headed by the notorious criminal Sandu Geamanu whose resume includes killing a 2 year old girl with a ninja sword. He too is a free man because of deals he made with the Romanian justice system to set up Becali for a fall. Corrupt Romanian prosecutors did not put him in jail for killing a 2 year old girl with a ninja sword, invoking the argument that \"he does not present a public risk\"! As incredible as this may seem, unfortunately it is very true.<br /><br />Gigi Becali is being targeted because he made public details of a corrupt business deal which implicates a Romanian-American businessman, high level Romanian government officials, and the US embassy in Bucharest. Becali himself was involved in widely known corrupt business deals but the justice system is not going after him on those charges because doing so will automatically implicate high level army and government officials which would also have to take the fall. So instead, the so called justice system is using this grand theft auto episode to arrest the victim of the car theft and not the actual thieves.<br /><br />The Romanian press is now asking half-joke, half-serious questions such as if someone is raped, should they try to go after the rapist and risk having the police arrest them instead of the rapist?<br /><br />This is communism at its finest and unfortunately it is a very real plague which is preventing Romania from moving away from its communist past.

But, if I were to hazard a guess, I would argue that it's informed by a view of the world in which American power\u2014and Western influence in general\u2014is waning, and that of the Far East and South Asia is rising.  That is, I would say Obama's perspective conforms closely to Fareed Zakaria's view in \"The Post-American World\" (which shouldn't surprise us because Obama was reading this book during the campaign).  If Obama does believe that America's total influence\u2014political, military, economic, and cultural\u2014is falling as that of other nations is increasing, what does he think is the proper course of action?  Should the U.S. reassert its economic and military dominance? Should it reinvent itself as a broker among competing factions and interests? Or, should America become a more passive observer of global affairs, content to focus on policies within its own borders?  I think Obama's actions and his disposition towards other nations at the G20 and NATO meetings suggest that he believes America should play the role of broker and deal-maker.<br /><br />In some ways, it is a shrewd move, as the U.S. will continue to have major influence in setting the world's agenda through politicking in the backroom  the nation doesn't have to grandstand at the podium to achieve its goals, for instance, on climate change, nuclear weapons proliferation, terrorism, Afghanistan, and Iraq.  On the other hand, the drawback of being inclusive is that the U.S. will have to compromise.  Not every issue we confront will have a win-win solution for all nations. Furthermore, Obama is likely to find that leaders around the world are willing to discuss the tough questions with him on how to achieve security and wellbeing in the 21st century, but lose their resolution when the time comes for common sacrifice and for joint action.  In those cases, will Obama decide to go it alone?  For instance, suppose developing and developed countries cannot achieve compromise on joint measures to reduce climate change. Will Obama wield the still enormous economic influence of the U.S. to threaten unilateral trade sanctions on carbon-intensive goods, such as steel, from developing countries?<br /><br />We don\u2019t have all the answers at this point, and I\u2019m not sure Obama does either.  It\u2019s still early and he is dealing with a crisis.   Nevertheless, it will be critical for him to make a decision about what is more important\u2014being the world\u2019s chief deal-maker or getting what America needs and wants\u2014to avoid confusion about America\u2019s goals with its preferred means of getting there.<br />", "created": "1239162941", "user": "David", "location": "Arlington, VA"}], "twitter_tinyurl_comments": [{"text": "The Obama years emerge.
