So instead of a huge system of trains to take us between our cities and towns  we wound up with a system of highways.

Detroit's recent financial meltdown does not stem from American auto executives' putative refusal to build fuel-efficient cars; each of the Big Three currently offers small  gas-sipping cars that offer good mileage (e.g.  the Ford Focus  the Chevy Cobalt  and the Dodge Caliber  to name a few).<br /><br />Unfortunately for the urban environmentalists who'd like to dictate automotive policy  such cars are money-losers for Detroit  for the simple reason that they cost more to build in high-wage American factories staffed by UAW workers than they can be sold for. Ford and GM both have extensive overseas operations  which make high-quality small cars that foreign consumers are happy to buy; and because of the lower labor costs  such cars make money for Ford and GM. Go to western Europe and you might be surprised to see how many Fords and Vauxhalls (a GM-owned brand) are on the road. So why can't the Detroit Three achieve that sort of success in their core domestic market?<br /><br />As Holman Jenkins points out in today's Journal  the reason is the \"two fleets\" mandate that prevents American car companies from importing foreign-made cars into the U.S.  requiring them instead to build high-mileage cars at a loss in UAW plants. Up until the recent surge in gas prices  this loss was made up on Detroit's bread and butter models  the big  gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs that have become so politically incorrect. Foreign car companies with manufacturing operations here do not face this obstacle  so they are free to build small cars in non-union American plants and sell them for a (small) profit. But it should be noted that those companies build big sport utes and trucks too  for the simple reason that the profit margin per vehicle is higher.<br /><br />I don't mean to defend those big rides  least of all the Hummer  which I personally find to be ugly as sin and piggishly wasteful.

We also need to listen skeptically and critically to our leaders instead of blindly following - that includes leaders on the left and on the right - when they tell us to shop until we drop in order to pull our country out of the economic abyss.  However  it is true that in order to sustain our current economic model  we have to continue to shop and consume.  As is now evident  when we do not consume with \"gluttony\" (as many people have referred to the level of American consumerism)  economies around the world that depend on our consumerism falter and will continue to be depressed. It is our purchasing power that has contributed in great part to lifting many people in developing nations out of poverty. Very many people in very many nations are dependent on Americans using 25% of the world's resources.<br /><br />It is also not helpful to continue blaming Bush  the Wall Street CEOs or auto executives (though I  too  would like to see some heads roll as convenient scapegoats on which to place blame) - people the world over  including Americans  Europeans  Asians  Africans  etc. are complicit in this by either enjoying the money and jobs that come from high levels of exports  enjoying the cheap goods and credit that come from those exporting countries  or gaining in the good years from unsustainable get-rich-quick investments that no one quite understood (e.g.  credit default swaps that many Europeans even invested in).<br /><br />Yes  we in America have a lot of work to do to perfect our union and there is much we can learn from the rest of the world about restraining the excesses of capitalism  improving levels of education  access to health care  and other social safety nets.  But  comparing life in America to life in Europe can be faulty. We do not have the same infrastructure or history - cities are a lot farther apart especially in Middle America which makes mass-transit solutions much more difficult and expensive  though we should spend a lot more energy and money in the near future trying to figure it out. Until then  people need their cars in order to get to places as essential as the local grocery store.  As a young nation  much of America's development has been completed post-automobile and before the spector of climate-change or high energy prices. While it may have been short-sighted  this has created many  if not most  communities that are spread out  with stores not being within walking or even biking distance to residential areas. (The exceptions to this developmental pattern are older cities on the East Coast) This paradigm is starting to shift with many newer developments - many communities are now being built as residential villages more along the line of \"Old World Europe\" where you can walk out of your house or apartment and easily access grocery stores  restaurants  and other stores. Europe  by contrast  has largely been developed for centuries  if not millenia and in most cases before there were cars.  Europeans  in many cases  can fairly easily walk down the street to the local bakery and grocery store (at least I could wherever I have lived in Europe including the Czech Republic  France  Germany and Russia).  However  they do have to contend with very narrow streets in cities and villages so must have smaller cars in order to negotiate the streets (with the exception of newer expressways and the autobahn of course).  It would be difficult to own large cars even if they had the desire. So to judge each other about the sizes of our cars and houses ignores the historical and logistical reasons for American and European choices in these matters and is not really helpful.

A carbon tax isn't a solution from within the market  and is a very good example of how markets and profit-seeking behavior can not be expected to regulate themselves  much less value long-term commitments to the environment for which there are no real penalties for violating.<br /><br />The truth is that market forces and competition have a dark side  one that can't be regulated or wished away by \"green\" capitalists  in addition to leading to innovation  market forces also lead to cutting corners  finding loopholes  and to the systematic misrepresentation of the environmental and social costs of individual policies. Clean coal is a superb example of this  no such thing exists  but the lobby is big enough that even Obama and the Democrats are in favor of it.<br /><br />If carbon taxation is the way to go  it will come as a mandate from the electorate  not from the market. It's important to recognize the significance of that  the forces of the market and the forces of democracy are by no means the same thing  nor do they have the same interests.

He is not trying to run GM's engineering  design or marketing programs.  He is simply trying to protect the US taxpayers' interests in obtaining repayment of the TARP funds that the US Treasury lent to GM to support its efforts to stave off bankruptcy (or at least as much as possible of those funds).<br /><br />The Treasury made it clear  at the time when it made the original TARP loans to GM  that it would not lend GM any more money unless GM obtained substantial concessions both from the UAW and from its bondholders.  Rick Wagoner initially won some significant concessions from the UAW  but the bondholders then refused to make any concessions whatever  basically arguing that a bond is a contract and a contract is sacred.  (Somehow  they seem to think that contracts are magically less sacred when they involve the UAW.)  Once the bondholders refused to make any concessions  the UAW refused to make any additional concessions.  Wagoner wasn't able to get the bondholders to budge.  This meant that GM wasn't going to get any more money out of Treasury unless something changed.<br /><br />Wagoner had to be thrown overboard to deliver the message to the recalcitrant bondholders that the time has come to deal or risk losing far more.

If a US bankruptcy court is forced by their intransigence to take on the massive job of overseeing and controlling the reorganization or dissolution of GM  and it is clear that GM  the UAW and the Treasury sought to avoid this but the bondholders were the holdouts who prevented that possibility  there is a good chance that the bankruptcy court will exercise its discretion to put the bondholders far down the list of priorities for repayment of creditors.<br /><br />There is no reason whatever that the contracts of bondholders should be any more sacred than the contracts held by the UAW.  People who insist upon the absolute sanctity of their contracts must be prepared to accept the consequences when their inflexibility drives their counterparties into bankruptcy.  If the bondholders think they can get a better deal in bankruptcy court  that is their choice -- but if the bankrupcty court puts the bondholders at the bottom of the priority list of creditors and they end up with little or nothing  the people taking satisfaction in that will include more than just UAW members  and indeed more than just the parties to the bankruptcy proceeding.", "created": "1238545156", "user": "02Pete", "location": "Delmar  NY"}, {"text": "The article offers nothing but dubious ideas and wishful thinking.<br /><br />The idea to entice people into showrooms by allowing 9 months to one year of grace for payments for those who are laid-off is one point of wishful thinking.<br /><br />What good are laid-off workers who are stuck with new vehicles who most likley will lose the vehicle in any case?

A bond is a promise made by the company to a bank or individual holder that they will repay the debt.  Stock-holders and employees are entitled to their wages (employees) and a share in the profit (stock-holders).  But when the company goes bust  the BONDs get repayed first.  Why do older people switch their investments from stocks to bonds as they near retirement - because bonds offer SAFETY.  A UAW or even white-collar worker is not entitled to anything until the bond holders are satisfied.  Because this is controversial process  the matter goes to COURT - which is a non-political venue.  Contracts and agreements are ranked in terms of priority.  A BOND is a superior debt  just like taxes are.<br /><br />Think about it this way  just because you get fired doesn't mean that you don't owe taxes for the money you earned in the year.  The government doesn't take a back-seat to other debts (mortgage  credit cards) and neither do bonds.<br /><br />On the matter of health care  as long as you have politicians like John Edwards who made millions suing hospitals  you will never fix the cost of health care.  My wife is a doctor and orders CT scans and MRI on simple cases to avoid the 0.01% chance she will get sued.  Doctors today don't practice medicine  they practice risk-management.  Think about that when you are trying to find an OB (most sued) to care for your soon-to-be born child.<br /><br />Canada's health care isn't superior  it is inferior.  The rich Canadians come to the states for their surgeries.  There is merit to allowing more access to health care clinics to encourage healthy lifestyles instead of disease management.

But it is also improper to practice risk-management medicine on that sick patient to shield doctors from lawsuits.

However  by using the IME \"brokers\" they know the brokers will do their dirty work and give them the \"no disability\" reports they really want  all the while keeping their own hands technically clean.<br /><br />Just do the math.  If the broker charges the insurer $400 per IME  but the doddering doctor only gets $100 per exam  that leaves a $300 profit for the broker per exam. If the article is correct  and over 100 000 IME's are performed in NY each year  then that's 30 million dollars of incentive for the brokers to provide the insurers with exactly what they want - \"no disability reports\".<br /><br />This is not rocket science. An easy solution is as follows  The WCB  under the guidance of its new medical director  should recruit a large panel of qualified IME's from various specialties. The insurance company will pay reasonable examination rates as set by the WCB directly to the IME.  When an insurer wants an IME  the WCB will select the IME from a rotating list  much like cases are assigned to judges in federal court.<br /><br />Without the economic pressure to produce the desired result for the broker or insurer  the \"qualified\" IME doctor might just give an honest opinion.  If the IME's give reasonable opinions  then perhaps some treating physicians won't feel the need to \"advocate\" for or \"inflate\" their own patient's disability to offset the predictably miserly IME findings. Possible? It's worth a shot. The current IME system is badly broken - if not utterly corrupt.<br /><br />One final note - the article gives the false impression that an injured worker's \"disability\" at the Workers' Compensation Board is determined solely by competing doctors. In fact  \"disability\" (or more correctly \"loss of wage earning capacity\")is determined solely by Workers' Compensation Judges after taking into account the worker's vocational background and education.  This simply allows the Judge to grant different \"disability\" ratings for the same injury depending upon whether the worker is a non-English speaking laborer or a Harvard MBA trained executive.

The abuses implied by the article  in which physicians employed by the insurance company may produce biased findings  are certainly believable. Physicians  like any other people  are fallible. They may make mistakes  and they may be influenced by other factors  such as the desire to continue getting such referrals by the insurance company.

As an attorney for injured workers  what I have found is that the employer-provided physicians provide extremely conservative treatment  often releasing the worker too soon.  I have had 2 cases where the physician opined that the employees had very minor impairments (only 2%)  but that the employees were severely injured enough that they could no longer perform their jobs.  That inconsistency reflects that the doctor does not want to give a higher impairment rating so the insurer won't have to pay much of an award  while acknowledging that the injury is significant. These physicians undoubtedly receive a significant number of referrals from the insurance companies. It was refreshing to see the physician in this article blatantly admit that this affects his evaluation of the patient.<br /><br />I have even had physicians cancel a prescription or change a prescription because the non-physician case manager  hired by the insurer  told the doctor to do so.  In effect  the case manager (a nurse) becomes the physician  with the physician's consent.<br /><br />Our system here is broken  and causes numerous injured workers to go without treatment and receive too little in compensation.  And  in my experience  the employer often just terminates the employee  because although our state law says you can't do that  the penalty (increasing the award  which is usually small anyway)hasn't much teeth.  This \"penalty \" if you will  is also eviscerated by the fact that our legislature \"reformed\" our comp law in 2004 by  among other things  effectively reducing the employee's award for permanent disabilities by 40%.<br /><br />Kudos to the NYT for exposing some of this.

Psychiatric exams  when done honestly  require a significant amount of time and effort - there are no tapping reflex hammers  spasmed muscles to palpate or stethoscopes to listen to sick hearts.

These actions go against the purpose of workman\u2019s comp  the essence of fairness and the fabric of society. Appalling practices of unfair denial of benefits or false rejections ought to be terminated with prejudice.<br />In my extensive experience with physicians at meetings and CME courses (over 30 years) I found that licensed physicians are very well-educated and experienced in these matters. They go through many many courses on how to conduct exams and write reports. Although there are disputes about the optimal treatment of conditions such as prostate cancer  physicians are well-trained on the procedures of relatively simple workman\u2019s comp medical exams. A medical exam for workman\u2019s comp is relatively easy (compared to usual diagnosis and treatment). It involves no treatment (the major problem in medicine). The claimant already comes with a diagnosis. There are substantial medical reports. The scope of the exam is very narrow. To me it is highly unlikely that substantial errors or overlooked data in the \u201cindependent\u201d reports are due to random mistakes or failure to notice.<br />Physicians may not be paid enough to conduct the exam and write an appropriate report. Although workman\u2019s comp are technically relatively easy  writing a good report takes considerable time. Physicians who have an active and valuable practice may find it unnecessary or not cost effective to earn extra income from workman\u2019s comp exams. Although many do honest work  a few may find it excusable to write quick denials to earn extra income.<br />In my experience with federal workman's compensation (FECA)  I believe some \u201cindependent examiners\u201d or physicians involved drastically distort reality. I believe there is substantial abuse of the process and substantial violation of constitutional rights and due process. With federal compensation there is limited court oversight. Claimants rarely can question the doctor or find out the specific reasons why a claim is denied. Extreme delays (many years) occur. The result is a system that discourages effective action by federal employees and gives enemies of the state a substantial advantage. Federal employees may be extremely cautious about taking risks that could lead to injuries when federal compensation may be illusory.<br />Federal law ought to be changed to mandate time limits for processing claims. Usually limits exist for claimants  but not for the entities that ought to make payments.<br />Although fraud does exist on the part of claimants  the system has shifted to make a mockery of fair and valid compensation claims. The law and procedures are usually fair  they just are not properly implemented and allow the system to abuse injured claimants.<br />I doubt that frequent participants (insurers  physicians  examiners who write reports) are unaware of what is going on. Apparently  they face practically zero risk of punishment for wrongdoing  and profits from their wrongdoing (such as fees to physicians for improper exams and perhaps compensation based on claims denied).<br />Physicians who write reports that are substantially incorrect or inappropriate under conditions when they knew what they were doing ought to be severely punished. Similarly for the employees who write reports denying claims based on reports or analysis they ought to know were improper or false.<br />Physicians who provide fradulent or otherwise substantially incorrect reports and were aware of what they were doing ought to be terminated. Their licenses ought to be permanently revoked. These activities are not minor mistakes or errors of judgement that can be corrected with further training. These activities represent a state of mind and behavior that is essential to the individual. As a matter of practice and law  they should be barred for life. These physicians should be subject to civil and criminal liability. The state (and injured individuals) should be allowed to pursue RICO charges. These activities are part of complex enterprises that bring terror to injured people  and obtain money improperly from insurers and the government (government is involved via tax subsidies and other matters) at the expense of employers and injured individuals. These improper activities alter the fundamental fabric and infrastructure of society causing severe harm like 5th columnists  terrorists and criminals.<br />Government employees or insurers who make a practice of writing improper reports to deny claims ought to be terminated with substantial prejudice.

The law and regulations also state a time line in which each step of the process in which an injured worker's case is heard is to be performed. They also provide a penalty against any of the participants in the process who do not follow the time line or provide the required information. The problem is not the law or the regulations. It is that the law and regulations are not being enforced.<br />The reason injured workers feel they are being rushed through hearings is because they are being rushed through the hearings. A hearing in which no sworn testimony has been scheduled (usually the first hearing or a hearing at which documents are to be submitted) is only allotted 10 or 15 minutes. In even a perfect world (where each attorney does not have several clients at whose hearings are sceduled to be heard at the same time in different hearing rooms)  10 or 15 minutes is not enough time to introduce the injured worker to the steps in the hearing process. More importantly  it is not enough time in which to determine the factual basis of his or her claim  come to an agreement on a date in which testimony or depositions will be taken and determine what other evidence the injured worker or the insurance company will produce. Insufficient time is not only allotted for hearings in which no sworn testimony is scheduled to be heard. Insufficient time is also allotted for hearings at which the injured worker and other witnesses are scheduled to testify. I have been at many hearings where witnesses and claimants who have made personal sacrifices to come to the hearing are told to come back in another six weeks or more. I have heard the reason for this is that the Workers Compensation Board only allots 15 minutes to an English speaking witness to testify. A non English speaking witness is given 30 minutes.This is unrealistic  even assuming that the attorney for the injured worker or insurance company is not in another hearing room doing another case that the Board has scheduled to take place at the same time.<br />The last major reason why there are problems at the Workers Compensation Board is the attitude of some attorneys at the Board. For many years  the Board hearings were not seen as part of a quasi judicial process  in which case law  statute  and regulations were applied to facts to determine the injured worker's rights. Rather  it was seen as a place where personal relationships and haggling were the methods by which a case was adjudicated. This  in turn  led to a decreased empohasis by some attorneys on consulting with their clients as to the facts of the case. Preparation before the hearing was also deemphasized. If a case could be settled (for better or worse) by simply talking to the opposing attorney on the day of the hearing and coming to an agreement  why should the attorney question witnesses. Many insurance companies simply tell their attorney a day or two before a hearing to show up for the hearing on a certain date. The attorney knows nothing about the case other than the name of the injured worker and what the attorney can read in the papers the injured worker has filed with the Board [In many cases the attorney can not even do that because the insurance company has not given the attorney the password or R number to access the injured worker's file.] Many attorneys for the insurance companies never speak to the employer or employer witnesses until several minutes before the employer or employer witnesses are to testify at a hearing.<br /><br />", "created": "1238604199", "user": "Atticus", "location": "New York"}, {"text": "Hi All   I can tell you from a professional's viewpoint -- psychiatrist of over 30 years -- the IME system (called the IPE system in psychiatry -- independent psychiatric examination) -- is  in my humble opinion  generally despicable.<br /><br />In my experience  there may be a few psychiatrists and psychologists who actually do a relatively professional and scientific job with their IMEs and IPEs.  However  it is a small group  and  probably  they don't last long in the system.<br /><br />The system is set up for corporate gain and is just another example of how corporations (and government employers) can influence science to get the outcome they want for the purpose of enhancing the bottom line.<br /><br />I have already asked the American Psychiatric Association (APA) to consider declaring ethicial guidelines for IPEs' but no luck.  They don't care about the biases inherent in IPEs anymore than they cared about raking in money from pharmaceutical companies.  It took huge media attention to get the APA to change its ways on pharmaceutical company money and biases... hmmm.. wonder what it will take on this?<br /><br />The fact is  and the APA doesn't seem to get it  is that there is no more malleable and manipulatible examination than psychiatric and psychological ones.  Psychiatry and psychology are far from  let's say  cardiology  and do not yet have the tools for really understanding the brain and behavior.  Thus  there are  as you know  many theoretical differences  beliefs  and biases -- from the personality disorder cultists to the biological genetic cultists.<br /><br />I asked the APA to engineer a system of IPEs in which there is a pool of approved IPE specialists who are designated for such work  and who are paid through a \"pool fund\" in which monies are deposited and held in escrow by the APA or otherwise paid to the provider in a way in which the provider does not know who paid them.

However  the US primacy has slipped and a complete failure of demand (which we now appear to suffer) has long been predicted as a natural consequence of the open market approach to world trade and development  that allows businesses to purchase and import products or components from the cheapest producing countries. Briefly  if automobile workers in Paris and Detroit are under pressure to accept the same wages as workers in Shanghai or join the ranks of the obsolete unemployed  they will no longer participate as blind consumers in the world economy; landlords and others in Paris and Detroit will be under pressure to charge what landlords and other businesses in Shanghai charge  the government in Paris or Detroit will lose the tax base which supported its infrastructure and social programs  and the developed world will turn fairly bleak compared to the one we knew.

No one can definitively say the stimulus will work. I understand the world's skepticism  but to do nothing is far worse.  We have to try everything at our disposal to avoid a much more catastrophic collapse.<br /><br />The Europeans scream regulation and lampoon our financial system at every turn.  They harp about our easy credit and reckless over consumption. At the same time they secretly pray that our stimulus works and we return to our easy credit and reckless over consumption.  They are  after all  the benefactors.  What they dont understand is it isnt coming back.  Americans have seen the light.   Watching their 401ks drop 50%  Gas prices at 4$ and their house values plummet has left a permanent scar. Much like it did for those who went through the great depression.  There will be no return to the boom days of the 90's and early 00's.  They will need to find new ways to stimulate their own economies w/out the American juggernaut.  China is already devising ways to promote domestic consumption and have the population to do it.  Germany  as the world's largest exporter  does not.<br /><br />This is why creating jobs in the public sector is so important.  The private sector will continue to shrink until we move to a new non carbon based system.  This will take years and money(lots of it) to develop.  Our govt's will need to bridge the gap until then.

Historical examples work better as an indication of what not to do or to suggest what types of leadership might be required.  Economies in the period before World War II were too different from today's economies.   There are too many variables in past situations to make any straight analogy work.  It is also naive to use Nazi Germany as an example of what to do - at least if you want to convince Europeans.<br /><br />While there has been a lot of discussion of the benefits of a smaller or larger stimulus package  we should be aware of the fact that most of what has been done so far is still in the same ball park.   There is no reason why all countries have to react the same.  Indeed there may be benefits to a mixed approach.<br /><br />The world economy has benefited from American dynamism and consumerism  but it has also benefited from European conservatism and Asian industry.  A balanced way out of the crisis may  in fact  be exactly what is required.   Europeans should appreciate the benefits of the United States' massive stimulus package.  The US should appreciate the European stress on better regulation and business morality.<br /><br />Americans should also be aware of the emotional content of the arguments.   Many Europeans see the US as having created the crisis by overspending and they don't see why the US shouldn't have to bear the brunt of the burden in any stimulus package.  They are also increasingly wary of American leadership - which they feel led to abuses not only in the United States but in European economies that bought into American business culture.<br /><br />The greatest danger is in countries acting alone - without coordination  without consultation - and in falling into the dangers of protectionism and nationalism.  This is especially important in Europe.   For example  one would hope to see a broader  multi-country approach to the problems of Central European economies than is presently the case.<br /><br />The message coming out of London should stress the commonalities and provide a guide to the roles each economy can play to help resolve the problems we face as a global community .<br /><br />", "created": "1238593668", "user": "John Chavez", "location": "Brussels  Belgium"}, {"text": "Sure enough  and every Marxist will agree  the stimulus of world wars  Hitler and Roosevelt and World War II  gets economies out of depressions.<br /><br />It does so by by destroying huge amounts of capital in war  and by employing the unemployed and many more  in restructuring industry as war industry  and in producing the goods of war  bombs  guns  planes  ships  explosives.
