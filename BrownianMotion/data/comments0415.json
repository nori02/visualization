The latter used to be a vital component of any newspaper's brief. It still is important, to an extent, but there are so many sources of info today.What the blog world can't replace is the big investigative stories that need time, resources, and experienced reporters and editors. It's not that there are no investigative reports coming in, but these usually revolve around personal or financial corruption - and often petty cases at that - and these stories often do little more than confirm people's cynical views of the world, and leave an ironic \"so what else is new?\" flavor in readers' mouths after they digest them. In its heyday, investigative journalism engaged readers because it delved into issues that were really important to those readers' lives and the future of their society or humanity.This is not to point the finger of blame completely at journalists. The problem is largely in the wider society. If journalists don't do big reports, it's mostly because it's pretty hard to identify a story that most people would consider \"big\" rather than merely titilating or angering. Big stories require a sense that they matter  that acting in response to them will correct a great injustice, prevent a catastrophe, and, even better, make a difference to the world and its future.Journalists today are good at theatrically noting their outrage, shock, and empathy in response to events, but the histrionics often conceal a surprisingly uncritical stance toward authority. For example, journalists love writing stories about shocking bank bonuses going to shocking bankers, and they REALLY love noting their anger at the bonuses. But emoting does little to advance our understanding of the economic crisis. Indeed, by hurling their moral indignation at the bankers, journalists are ironically and uncritically reading the script written by our political leaders, who were extremely complicit, even instrumental, in inflating the credit bubbles of the past three decades and overseeing the decline of manufacturing industry that lies at the root of the crisis. Question  shouldn't journalists be shedding more light on the political class whose policies did much to cause the crisis and now claims to be able to solve it, rather than kicking a handful of \"greedy\" bankers (who actually staff the financial wing of the Obama government?)More generally, one solution might be for more reporters to start spending more time testing the received widsom on issues that seem to command so much interest today, such as global warming, or diet-related issues such as how harmful cholesterol is. These issues are important because they do much to reflect and shape our attitudes toward humanity and what we call the modern world and its potential. Many analysts have noted the disconnect between scientific reports on the environment and many health-related issues, on the one hand, and the \"facts\" that actually make it into the news, on the other.Here, journalism does share some blame for its own decline  as a profession it has become too complacent and spends too much time moralizing on subjects that allow them to score easy points by striking a crusading stance on issues. A case in point is the current global economic meltdown. There were numerous Cassandras out there before the crisis unfolded, but few of these voices were screaming their messages from the mainstream newspapers, let alone from the front pages.In the aftermath, however, we've had journalists falling over each other to shoot their darts at those \"responsible\" for the meldtdown. We've had journalists investigating different facets of the bubble years. Unfortunately, however, it's all post festum, which means that while the stories might make good reading and even form the stuff of a good book, they don't really meet the \"Extra! Extra!

I suggest that Americans and Europeans skip the likes of Cancun and Ixtapa for a nice trip to Mexico City or Chihuahua and see for yourselves the opportunities that exist for the 'middle-class' mexican.Maybe they need our guns to break the backs of the oligarchs and ruling families that have fleeced most of the nations wealth and oil reserves for years.

The 90% comes from firearms that are actually requested to be traced, which is a fraction of the total number of guns confiscated.  In 2007-2008, close to 6,000 guns were successfully traced, and 90% of those were traced to the U.S.  Most were not submitted to the ATF for tracing because it was clear by their markings that they did not come from the U.S., or they were deemed untraceable.  This means that of the total guns confiscated in those two years (approx. 29,000), over 83% of the guns found at crime scenes could NOT be traced to the U.S.  This hardly makes the U.S. into the major supplier of guns to the Mexican drug cartels.

Congress is disgustingly cowardly in caving in to the NRA.  Obviously gun shows need to be monitored and there needs to be a national gun registry. You mean to tell me that you have to register a car but not a gun? This is insane. No wonder it is so difficult to trace guns back to its owner and even seller.  It is true that cartels can buy guns anywhere. That is still not an excuse for not enacting tougher gun laws in America.  One immediate solution is to legalize marijuana, a drug more benign than alcohol,physically non addictive, and in addition has great medicinal benefits.  Keeping it illegal has not curtailed its use at all, and has diverted law enforcement from more pertinent activities.  In addition it legalization would cripple the cartels economically. With less money and no market in America, they would have significantly less money or need to by guns in America. President Obama is trying to teach the country how things are interrelated, like health care costs and our economic crisis. There is obviously a relationship  between the illegality of marijuana in America and the growth and power of the cartels in Mexico and the gun purchases that go with it.  Marijuana, not heroin or cocaine is the chief revenue source of the cartels. Legalize it, and they are cut off at the knees. As simple as that.  We already have an example in our own history about the failure of Prohibition. One of the first acts of FDR was to repeal it. All Prohibition did was allow the mafia to grow and prosper,just as is the case with the Mexican cartels.  It has already been proven that abstinence programs are not successful in preventing Aids, pregnancy and the spread of STD's in teens. Likewise, keeping marijuana illegal will not curtail its use. It is the social stimulant of choice both baby boomers and their children. It is not going away. Legalizing it would also give needed revenues to the states, provide income for farmers and certainly reduce deaths caused by drunk drives and murders committed by people who inebriated.Alcohol lessens inhibitions and makes people aggressive physically and sexually. Marijuana does not have these side effects. Quite the opposite in fact.  There are not always law enforcement or military solutions to problems. Legalizing marijuana would deprive the cartels in Mexico of their major source of revenue. It may then be easier for the Mexican government to control or eliminate them. It would stop the flow of American guns to Mexico.  I am also tired of the Mexican government pointing a finger at America as the one who is responsible for their drug problems and societal disruptions. Mexico has a plethora of social problems, social injustices, corruption and massive income inequities and poverty, that were their before the cartels gained power, and will be their after their fall.  If the cartels are bought down by depriving them of their main income source in America, maybe Mexico can then focus of solving its massive social problems and other law enforcement issues like the rape and murders of female factory workers in Juarez, which is still going on and for which there have been pitiful few arrests or convictions.

In the first place, it is not \"out of date\" any more than the other parts of the Bill of Rights.  It's purpose remains as true today as it did in 1776 and will continue to do so as long as people attempt to tyrannize others.The idea behind the Second Amendment was not that the country would fight all future wars without the use of \"regulars\" (the Revolution was fought, in part, with \"regular\" troops).  It was also not merely to provide for a government-run mlitia-quite the opposite.  The idea was that so long as the citizenry remained armed it could act as a bulwark of last resort against the tyranny of the government.  This informal citizen's \"militia\" was intended as the final line of defense for all of the other rights preserved by the Constitution, including the First, which is being exercised right on this forum.  The federalist papers and other documents of the period make that abundantly clear.In order for that provision to have any teeth whatsoever, citizens of today would need arms adequate for militia-type service.  The closest weapons that adequately fulfill that role and are generally legal to own in this country are semi-automatic rifles and carbines.  More antiquated systems would have far less utility and thus would not fulfill the intended role.  As for whether or not anyone \"needs\" such weapons, I would posit that every citizen \"needs\" such weapons if they take the Constitution and all of its provisions seriously.  Moreover, since when does one's \"need\" dictate what are his or her Constitutional rights?  One does not \"need\" to exercise free speech or freedom of religion or any of a host of other rights that I would wager most on this forum hold dear.  It is a \"right,\" not a \"need.\"  Further, none of us \"need\" to drink alcohol or drive a car, both of which kill scores and scores more people than guns in this country every year (when one removes suicides from the statistics, the gap becomes even greater), but the majority ardently support the continued use of both.Millions of people in this country own firearms and do not commit crimes.  Their are thousands of examples of people legally carrying firearms that have thwarted a crime, including murder.  Firearms often provide a necessary measure of equalization for people that are physically weaker than their attacker or simply outnumbered.  Should those people be left helpless?It doesn't take a firearm to commit murder.  Thousands are killed each year by knives in this country and others.  Should we ban knives too?  (Before you laugh, they're considering just that in the UK, where they have had knife violence go up in the wake of their near total ban on firearms ownership).  Just last year a man in Japan killed seven and wounded a dozen more using a knife.  The problem isn't guns, it's people misusing them.  Many other legal items can also be misused to commit murder in large numbers.  Banning firearms and trampling on Constitutional rights is not the answer.

This is made difficult because not only can anyone without a background check buy guns at gun shows but straw buyers with clean backgrounds can purchase many weapons and don't have to prove they have held onto their gun purchases. The NRA has also supported legislation to conceal records to the public about where guns have been purchased so the public doesn't know which gun dealers have been responsible for supplying weapons which are sold on the black market. In addition who knows how many guns that have had their serial numbers removed were purchased in the states? In our system it is also up to the gun sellers to report suspicious purchases. However, they have a finiancial interest in not reporting because it will affect their profits. Greed is behind the actions of the drug dealers and greed is behind the gun manufacturers support of the NRA and its resistance to sensible changes in gun laws in the US. Unfortunately conspiracy gun advocates will jump on the liberal media for not including the \"traced\" in their reporting. The NYTimes should clarify this so it cannot be used(as another contributor wrote) as a \"redherring\" or for fear mongering purposes that promote the fantasy that the liberal \"fascist\" American government is going to take all of your guns away.Unfortunately, the sad truth is that the drug cartels will have their demand for guns supplied by other markets, but that doesn't mean the US should sit by and do nothing because like it or not we have blood on our hands.", "created": "1239801217", "user": "alex", "location": "brooklyn"}, {"text": "In response to this comment And what does any \"law-abiding\" civilian need with a military-type firearm such as the civilian version of the AK-47 with it's rapid - fire capability and external, quick-change magazine?

If this is reverence I would rather be hated. They despise women and consider them nothing but a necessary evil for procreation.Religion in general has kept women down. None are as ghastly as the Muslims, but they certainly don't consider women the equal to men. I attended a Southern Baptist wedding last summer and I was appalled at the marriage ceremony. The minister went on and on about how a \"good Christian wife\" submits to her husband in every way and defers to his superior status. I was very gratified during the reception where I was seated at a table with some young people, some of whom were members of the wedding party. These young people, who were Baptists themselves, were equally appalled at what the minister said. One of the young men said he thought it was a bunch of bull____.I also look at the religions that require women to dress in certain so-called modest ways. The men have no such requirements. The Pentacostal women around here swelter in the summer heat wearing long skirts and long sleeved tops while the men dress as they please. The women are never allowed to cut their hair because the bible says a woman's hair is her \"glory.\" I asked a Pentacostal woman I know if they ever thought of cutting their long hair to donate for wigs for poor women going through chemo. She said they couldn't do that because it would go against god's law.Until the Griswald decision, birth control was illegal in Connecticut. An interesting twist however  condoms were legal. That tells me that the intent of the law was for men to decide when a woman would get pregnant. This arcane law was passed under the influence of the Catholic church, and we all know how they feel about women.In this country, wife beating is still not taken seriously enough even though it is given lip service. I had a friend who was beaten within an inch of her life with a tire iron by a man she wanted nothing to do with. When it was found out that she was just slightly acquainted with him, the case was put under the umbrella of \"domestic violence\" and he was given a slap on the wrist.

Those not from Ohio may not realize what a nightmare has been created here - schools are funded primarily from property taxes, which are not allowed to increase with inflation.  Because of that, property taxes are on the ballot in most districts every 2 or 3 years, and the only tax that voters get to vote on directly is the one that funds education, so all the tax anger gets taken out on the schools.

Countless conservatory-trained musicians, contest winners, principal players supplement their income working non-musical part-time jobs, teaching, master class fees, etc.  Classical music is a very expensive career choice for the performer, no matter what level said performer is at.

My wife took Temodar, a pill form chemo for two years.  The first year we had a 30/mo Rx co-pay for the medicine.  Then her insurance changed at work and we had to write checks for over $2000 a time, until our out of pocket maximum (OPM) was reached.  The OPM would have been reached anyway due to MRI's, so it was not a big issue.  Then the insurance was changed again... no more Rx costs going towards the OPM, and the allowable costs jumped on the Temodar and would have cost us much more.So we learned how to play the system.  Each morning my wife would go to the Oncology department at the hospital, check in as a patient, then take the pill chemo, and check out.  Services were covered by insurance because it was doctor administered chemo, like an IV would have been.  Now were still hitting our OPM, but we found a way to get her Rx covered and we don't exceed the OPM.Worth mentioning that Rx manufactures like Schering Plough, who make Temodar, will offer discounted prices for those who financially qualify.  However, that doesn't include most people, so these costs can add up quickly.One other thing we found happened a lot, is we receive bills all the time for lots of money that are erroneous, because the hospitals and the insurance companies can't get in sync.  For instance, we reached our OPM for 2008, and yet we still get bills from the hospital for that calendar year in excess of $5k.  Be very careful is my advice.  Know your coverage and become an advocate for your rights.  Keep a spreadsheet of what you paid and never write a check for a dime more than your OPM for any given year.  Once you do, you will not see the money again, and most of the bills we get are simply wrong.Billing for medical expenses and insurance costs is a big business, creating a huge drain on consumers and the industry.

Of course his life has not been affected by it one bit, but rather everyday Cubans feel the brunt of the trade restrictions.2. Regime change must come from within.  Cubans see the influx of tourists from a number of European countries and Canada and they see their Nikes and Ipods and want the same things.  If our goal is a \"free\" Cuba, the best strategy is to let Americans travel there and let human interaction do the trick. Cubans are curious to know what life if like outside and they want the life that they think tourists have.  Allowing Americans to interact with Cubans will hasten the transition to a free market system.3.  The embargo/blockade, while vile and useless, is used by Castro as a blanket excuse for everything that is wrong on the island. If you take that excuse away, he rhetoric will no longer be valid and his antics will be exposed for what they really are.4.  Travel restrictions are hypocritical.  How can we talk about the Land of the Free when the US government restricts where its citizens can travel due to ideological differences?

When his baliwick yielded to an upstart named Castro he and most of his corrupt supporters inclduing the American mob headed to points beyond.America rebuffed the Castro overtures to accept him for waht he was-George Washington of Cuba-as the CIA actually led a rag-tag group of misfits to invade the island which soon went down in defeat. This and other US actions  pushed the all too willing upstart (See Duck Soup for the real meaning of upstart) into the hands of the USSR.So Castro did what any politican did, especially one who fought in the jungles to get into power  he shot and jailed his enemies, many of the former dictator's ilk and even some of his own.The rest of the 1%ers, the rich, educated, the gainers of ill-gotten wealth headed to Maimi. They left their country so they could continue to life the good life while crying about how bad Castro was and forgetting to mention Batista. And as a small group of emigrating dissidents they turned America to the right of the political spectrum not only in Florida but elsewhere. They were angry about being sqeezed out of power after their once darling Batista took off.America being the progressive, caring, kind, world leader took up the fight and tried to strangle this little country that once belonged to criminals, abortionists and the hanger-oners of the doomed dictator. Despite everything, Cuba made its way, sometimes not as proud as it could have been, but with a hostile America just 90 miles from its shores, it survived.So today, as the old crusties of Batista go to their nursing homes and graves, the younger generation (Generation-C) want to get back home, even if only to visit.

Since the United States is a better place to live than Cuba, with more freedoms, it makes no sense for US citizens to be prevented by their government from travelling there.Therefore, Obama's decision to lift travel restrictions on Americans with Cuban relatives is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough. All Americans, not just some of them, have the right to travel to Cuba, just as they have the right to travel to China, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, or Afghanistan.Continuing to block travel to Cuba by all Americans shows that the US is afraid of something. But if the US is superior in every way to an impoverished communist island, then this fear is irrational. A poor little country like Cuba cannot possibly harm the United States.I believe there is a fear that allowing normal relations between the US and Cuba would prolong the existence of the communist regime there. That might be true or it might be untrue. Perhaps normal relations would create so much pressure on the Castro brothers that they would have to quickly make liberal reforms. Maybe a flood of US cash and new business ties would help to create rival power centers to the central government. Nobody knows. All we do know is that cutting Cuba off from its largest neighbor for 60 years hasn't brought any regime change and it isn't likely to in the future.To look at other examples, North Korea is cut off from the rest of the world, and its regime has been passed from father to son and will probably do so again when Kim Jong-Il dies. On the other hand, opening up to and having normal relations with communist China helped to create a manufacturing boom there which led to massive liberal reforms which have freed millions of Chinese from poverty and provided inexpensive goods for everyone else in the world. Today, the world is looking to an economically powerful China to help get us out of the financial mess we are in.The Chinese government is still called 'communist', but hardly anyone in China cares.

Without this myth of an external threat to the very existence of the country that overrides everything else, the regime would probably be unable to survive its current condition of chronic economic crisis. North Korea is a zombie nation that would not survive peaceful cooperation with Japan, the US, and other countries.It's natural that the Japanese public is worried about the latest missile test, which in fact seems to have been a ballistic missile test using a missile that flew over Japan. North Korea has clearly proved that it could send missiles to Seoul and Tokyo.Since North Korea can exist only artificially, as a militarized nation in a state of permanent, total mobilization (ironically, a state that resembles Japan during WWII), the only long-term solution is for the US and Japan, with some help from South Korea, to engage in secret negotiations designed to lead ultimately to the reintegration of North and South Korea into one nation with a general amnesty for all the North Korean leaders. Former President Kim Dae-jung hoped to achieve some such reunification, but when he studied the economics of German reunification he is said to have entered a state of severe shock. South Korea alone simply does not have the means to offer North Korea enough aid to make reunification economically feasible. Therefore the US and Japan must play the leading role in making the reunification of the two Koreas economically feasible while South Korea takes the lead politically.Basically the North Korean missile problem and the problem of international verification at the North's nuclear sites should be treated as parts of a single long-term plan to reunify North and South Korea on terms that do not humiliate or demonize the North. The negotiations will need to be secret at first because saving face will be a major consideration for North Korea, and public pronouncements would destroy any preliminary discussions.Former president Carter performed very well as an envoy for president Clinton. Perhaps he could still be of service to try to coordinate US, Japanese, and South Korean efforts to persuade North Korea to reunify for the greater benefit of the whole Korean people. Or perhaps a better envoy could be found. In any case, there must be a major commitment to economic aid for the North and also for the South, which will bear the major economic burden of reunification.It's important for Obama and Hillary Clinton to think big about North Korea. Haggling, finger-pointing, and self-righteousness by the US would be counter-productive.

Appeasement by Republicans or Democrats doesn\u2019t work. Take note Obama.  \u2014 Tom Wonacott, Boise.I agree with him.      The current Kim is known to be worse than his predecessor.  His predecessor invaded the South on the early Sunday morning June 25, 1950 with no previous sign while vast majority of people in the South were still in bed, with Russian-made tanks and other artilleries.  Many in the South fought with bare fists. Kim is willing and capable to do anything - attack on South or the United States.  He will, if he determines that there is no other option, allure many of his brain-washed people in the North to commit suicide \u2013 Let\u2019s remember Jones Town!      What is worse than the current Kim are the communist China and the communist Russia.  They are the ones who supported the North before, and during and after the Korean War.  They are the ones who use and support the North for their communist agenda to occupy and oppress the entire world.      After the brutal Japanese colony over Korea ended, the Koreans wanted a united Korea based on an American-style democracy.  Russia used the former Kim to divide Korea in half for their ideological war \u2013 to spread communism in the world.  They succeeded in their plan with a total success.  They would have occupied the Northern half, if they could.  But, you don\u2019t have to occupy a land to spread your ideology, as long as there are people who bow before your ideology.  It is the same as, in fact it may be more effective than, occupying that land.  That is what they did to Korea and to other parts of the world and that is, I believe what they are trying to do right now.  They do not need to propagate communism by a well-defined theory of communism.  For them, such is, practically and strategically, ineffective.  All they need is something even remotely close to their ideology.  In other words, all they need is anything that is contrary to what they are absolutely sure in their mind that they need to destroy.  And that is the ideology of freedom and liberty of conscience.  They are at destroying, by all means, the ideology of God-given liberty and freedom of conscience.  Stalin is quoted as saying, something to the effect that, evolutionism is what leads to revolution.  The Russian communists will use and support anything.  They will use socialism - which is nothing but a sugar-coated form of communism.  They will use evolutionism.  They will use atheism.   They will use abortion.  They will use homosexuality. They will use Islam \u2013 Islam would love to use communism, by the way.  They will use even Roman Catholicism \u2013 Roman Catholicism would love to use communism, by the way, also.

But there is also a big difference in that Iran is a unified nation that is a viable economic entity, while North Korea is neither. Many of North Korea's people are starving or living near starvation, and its recent ballistic missile test disguised as a satellite launch was made not only to further glorify its already glorious leader but -- even more importantly -- to develop expensive new hardware and technology for sale to regimes (and rich rebel groups) in central Asia and elsewhere. Economics is the major key to dealing with North Korea, while it is a less overwhelming issue in dealing with Iran.North Korea is a fragment of a nation, a cold-war time capsule that basically has no future, and a Bush-style neo-cold-war confrontational approach would be self-defeating for the US. The reunification of North and South Korea is only a matter of time, with the North being transformed into part of the larger whole, much as East Germany was. Recognition of this inevitable reunification must be the keystone of US-Korean policy. The fundamental questions for the US are not if but how soon Korean reunification will occur and what role the US can play in aiding this process.The US, which has troops and nuclear weapons in South Korea, must stand firm against any military -- including nuclear -- threat from the North. But the major thrust of US policy toward North Korea should be economic. And it should not be simply piecemeal, such as offers of aid in return for closing reactors, etc. Instead, the US must formulate a comprehensive economic plan for supporting the South as it goes through the painful process of incorporating the North during the next couple of decades. South Korea is nowhere near as wealthy as West Germany was when it incorporated East Germany, and this difference is the major factor now blocking the reunification of Korea. The present president of South Korea is a former businessman, and the enormous cost of reunification is a major reason for his coldness toward the North.Japan should also bear some of the cost of Korean reunification. It has still not paid reparations due North Korea for WWII and for Japanese colonization of Korea, even though Korea would not be a divided country today if Japanese troops had not been in Korea in 1945 -- a fact that allowed the USSR to occupy the northern half under the guise of disarming Japanese troops.China and Russia should also help finance Korean reunification, but they may balk, since both feel the North is a convenient buffer zone at their borders. Even if they refuse to give aid, however, the US and Japan should go ahead alone, since a reunified Korea would be peaceful and probably pro-US -- but without US troops on its soil.

Realistically, there is nothing we can actually DO about the countries he mentions. We have to be satisfied with our new President who does not ABSOLUTELY reject the use of force but, as far as I understand him, will consider it only as a measure of last resort when this country, not its 'interests', would be in an immediate danger. Not likely to happen anytime soon - the only people who can really hurt us are Russians but MAD worked fine for decades and still exists. The rest of the world may behave badly but without any serious impact on our security.Specifically  North Korea may have several nuclear weapons that, so far, do not work too well. It may be developing long range missiles but, so far, they do not work too well either. The best thing would be, I strongly believe, to ignore them. OK, a few words of criticism may not hurt too much from time to time - Friedman is correct that the existence of regimes like North Korea and Iran depends very much on having the diabolical United States as their mortal enemy not worth a real reconciliation. That said, our civil behavior (Obama's behavior) may slow down Iran\u2019s effort to become a nuclear power, for instance. We have to realize, however, that there is absolutely no way to reliably prevent ANY country to go nuclear.Iran armed with nuclear weapons is not a threat to us. It is to Israel but the situation will be just another instance of MAD. We provide all the help and weapons Israel needs but Israel itself was never interested in a mutual defense treaty with us or anyone else. And that is how it should be. We cannot solve problems like Israel-Palestine conflict and, perhaps, we should not even try.Does it sound like isolationism? Perhaps, and after decades of facing the 'godless Communists' we should relax - nobody is going to attack us except the terrorists and if we establish a true homeland security, we can reduce that threat significantly without ever eliminating it.I am personally sick and tired of the endless talk about 'axis of evil', 'failed states' and conduct unbecoming of this or that country or a group of people.The recent pirate episode was, to me, the best demonstration of our power and extraordinary skills. The three pirates were killed but nobody, as far as I know, is planning to shell or bomb the Somali pirate bases. We set an example (perfect compared to not-so-perfect French confrontation with pirates short time ago) and we should leave it at that. NO NATION BUILDING for Somalia - it is a dubious proposition even for Afghanistan and, more importantly, for huge and populous Pakistan for reasons Friedman accurately states.So, Mr. Friedman, your observations are accurate. Your conclusion are, however, just too traditional and timid. Pax Americana should have a very narrow meaning  protection of our homeland from direct large scale attacks. As terrible 9/11 was, it had no effect on this country except psychologically (and, of course, the thousands of lives lost - always a serious matter that, however, has no effect on the country as whole).Mr. Cohen in this paper is, so far, closest to my way of thinking.

I think, in this specific case, a joint Iranian- American- Indian (?) campaign to stabilize Afghanistan might have the greatest legitimacy in the perception of key stakeholders and geo-politically. However, cobbling together that coalition (hardly of the willing) requires challenging a cornerstone of the world-view that we, that have grown up in democratic countries, have been conditioned with.All other scenarios- in which actions are taken in line with that world-view (aiding Pakistan, more troops/aid in Afghanistan, Indian non-alignment)will take the region towards unpredictability.

The projections on those prices were exceptionally high in the first place.  A ten or twenty percent discount is not enough.  The discount should be more like forty percent if not fifty percent.  Many developer companies buy the land at a very profitable price in other words the pay a much lower amount for the land and then sell the land back to themselves at a much higher price and charge the higher cost to the development.  So in effecft they have alraedy made their profit, so now they are charging you with the new higher cost of the land.  This is common practice in the real estate industry.

Scientists have been developing GMOs for less than one human lifetime, and there is simply no way for humans to know in advance the full implications or unintended consequences of any genetic modifications.Furthermore, there are troubling gaps in the scientific record. For example, scientists have only recently mapped the human genome, along with a few other species. More disturbingly, scientists are only just beginning the decades-long process of mapping the human proteome (i.e. all the proteins in the human body). And once such a catalog of proteins is complete, scientists would still have very little understanding of what all these proteins do or how they interact.So GMOs are a recent agricultural, biological, and environmental experiment, in which ordinary people and animals and crops are the guinea pigs, and companies like Monsanto accrue the benefits.Now compare the decades-long human experiment with GMOs with the thousands of years that mother nature has been experimenting via natural selection and other biological processes.And further consider that for all of human history people have been eating non-GMO foods and managing quite well, thank you very muchGiven these points, it is apparent that nature is the best laboratory possible, and I see no reason for me or my family to take part in Monsanto's experiment.

Farmers have happily followed exactly this process for the last 60 years with (non-GM) hybrid seeds. Why would they conform to such a pricing structure? Because the benefits of the improved genetics in terms of disease resistance, yield, output traits, etc. far out-weigh the added cost to the farmer. If they don't believe that they're benefiting from the cost of the seed, they can use \"free\" seed that they've saved. In fact, farmers have voted (with their wallets) overwhelming in favor of commercially-produced seeds and companies have reciprocated with investments of billions in research, and everyone, including the consumer, has benefited.With respect to the safety of GMOs, I believe that the few genes currently in commercial use are some of the most highly-studied and well-characterized genes known. For example, the rennin used in making cheese is a GM product that no one seems to complain about - the alternative to the GM product is the traditional extract from cow stomachs. Contrast this level of understanding with the ~30,000 found in any non-GM plant in your refrigerator  in those plants, fewer than a few hundred genes are likely to have been characterized at even a superficial level. Most \"naturally occurring\" genes and their products in our foods have never been identified or studied.The most exciting GM plants are those that offer tremendous environmental benefits. The fact is that our farm economy (and the large chunk of the world's economy that this includes) depends on massive chemical inputs such as pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers. While I'm a firm believer in organic farming (and have worked on one myself), I'm also a realist  the size of the human population makes it impossible to convert our current farming systems to organic farming in the foreseeable future. However, GM plants that have genetic-based disease resistance (dramatically reducing the need for pesticides), or corn that has the nitrogen-fixing properties of legumes transferred via transgenes, or that increase nitrogen utilization thereby decreasing run-off into our streams and rivers - these are exciting prospects with clear environmental benefits. In fact, GM seeds can facilitate and substantially enhance organic cultivation methods.  Another example of benefits of GM plants is from Hawaii, where a virus threatened to end the cultivation of papaya. A simple GM modification rendered the papaya resistant, saving papaya farmers there. A further example is the elimination of allergenic proteins in plants such as peanuts, which has the potential to save lives if children with food allergies were to accidently come in contact with the product.The curious thing is that if a scientist transfers a gene via traditional breeding methods, it is a crude an imprecise transfer that can take along hundreds or thousands of unknown and uncharacterized genes. Yet this is considered safer and more \"natural\" than using a transgenic approach that transfers just the one gene of interest. If ionizing radiation is used to induce mutations, this is considered \"natural\" and the resulting plants are not transgenic - yet those plants likely carry thousands of uncharacterized changes to the DNA, versus a single change of a transgenic plant. The issues are not black-and-white, not as simple as the idea that GMOs are bad and non-transgenic plants are always better.Companies, Monsanto in particular, have done a poor job, historically, in handling GM issues of plants, but their job has been complicated because their discussion of the issues of safety and the nature of GM alterations have largely been countered with emotional and subjective responses rather than objective and scientifically sound (and supported) responses. How can one have a reasonable discussion when the two sides are arguing on entirely different levels and are each making points that make sense, in the context of the level on which they are arguing?  My own opinion is that GMOs are no less safe than any other product on the market (probably more safe as they're in general much better studied than the non-GMO versions of the same product), but people should be given the option to chose to not purchase them via labeling, since there are so many emotions surrounding the issue.", "created": "1239754212", "user": "B", "location": "Newark, DE"}, {"text": "No........After what's happen on Wall Street and Banks hiding their losses,why should the public trust any business to tell the truth.", "created": "1239754981", "user": "Hudson-DC", "location": "Washington DC"}, {"text": "I do not understand the corporate motive for developing GMO food - I think that it is telling that they lobby hard to prevent consumers from being able to identify what foods contain GMO foods.I do not want GMO foods in my diet.", "created": "1239758153", "user": "AnneCW", "location": "Chicago"}, {"text": "IMHO as an Iowa born American, WWII/Cold War veteran, both military/civilian in the foreign affairs community I couldn't agree more about the use of chemicals, etc in today's agricultural production bringing harm and medical problems to all.

And yes, it does happen and has happened.   You can look up the NAS report I mention next for specific examples.In the 2003 NAS report \"Safety of Genetically Modified Foods\", the National Academy of Sciences ranked various breeding techniques with respect to their estimated likelihood of giving rise to unintended consequences i.e. their expected riskiness.  The highest ranking (i.e. expected to be riskiest) was not a GM technique, but a conventional breeding technique  induced mutagenesis.  All the objections people raise about GM foods apply to it, even moreso, but no one is concerned about it.  There are no calls for studies of its safety (even though it has only within the last couple of decades been applied in a widespread manner to food people eat, and its safety, short-term and long-term, hasn't been studied), no calls for products developed with the technique to be labelled (impossible anyway, because tracking hasn't been done and in general no one knows what organisms have been developed with induced mutagenesis).Anyhow, that demonstrates how seriously you should take people's claims about feeling unsafe eating GM foods.  It's not because of any legitimate concerns about not enough study of safety being done, or else they'd be up in arms about mutation breeding too.

The answer depends entirely on what the crystals are, not the fact that they were added.A plant makes proteins from the genes we add, just as it makes proteins from the genes that evolution added.  Humans adding or taking away genes is not an inherently good or bad thing.  The resultant change in genetic information is biologically indistinguishable from changes made by evolution.  Truly, a DNA molecule produced by evolution is chemically identical to one produced by humans.  And if two things are chemically identical, they are identical in every sense.Those in categorical opposition to GM food are sending back their cheeseburger because someone shook salt on it.  Indeed, categorical opposition or support of a food with human-added genes betrays a serious lack of understanding.The question really is not whether we support GM foods--it's whether we think each specific case of a GM food is okay or not.  And in every case so far, the \"white crystals\" added to foods have truly been as harmless as table salt.Some GM foods have genes that give resistance to an herbicide, as is the case with Roundup Ready organisms.  Some have genes that specifically kill butterfly and moth larvae, as is the case with Bt plants.  And some have genes that produce vitamin A, as is the case with golden rice.  Though we're always learning more about individual proteins, the human-added proteins that these GM foods produce are well-studied and well-understood.  They each have one function and they pose no risk to humans.The dangers of GM food are socio-economic, as others have pointed out in the case of Monsanto, and environmental, as is the case with Bt corn pollen killing moth species that are not corn pests.  As with any new technology, we need to think with nuance and with facts if we are to properly assess its costs and benefits.It should go without saying that the best way to evaluate GM food is to think analytically and scientifically, not emotionally or irrationally.  If any readers have a \"fear\" of GM foods, consider how you might view someone who had a fear of restaurant-prepared food on the grounds that the food was modified from the way it came out of the ground.  You might tell this person that restaurants are not inherently safe or unsafe--the real issue is whether the restaurant's kitchen is clean and free of harmful contaminants, and whether the food is thoroughly cooked.  It's not that restaurants are good or bad, it's whether an individual burger joint is safe.  You might think your restaurantophobic friend should slow down and learn about the facts.  This is how scientists feel toward people who are afraid of GM food.Just take it easy, pick up a molecular biology textbook (Alberts's Molecular Biology of the Cell is a good one), learn about what genetic modification actually is, and begin to judge GM foods on a case-by-case basis.", "created": "1239766229", "user": "Graham Anderson", "location": "Palo Alto, CA"}, {"text": "No I don't but in reality I wouldn't know the difference anyway unless it was clearly identified.

Citing the pledge to first do no harm can be used to excuse any inaction, but most tellingly, it disguises that great harm has already been done  refusal to resolve the perceived and probable insolvency of financial in-stitutions does ongoing and irreparable harm to those sound businesses and indi-viduals that are driven into insolvency by the continued stagnation of money and credit that is always caused by ongoing insolvency of major financial institutions.\tGeithner and Summers have effectively nationalized the financial system so that it continues as a leach on the economy, sucking the blood out of the productive parts. The magnitude and nature of this financial crisis makes it different than those they are used to dealing with. Those smaller scandals merely required pro-viding the temporary liquidity, confidence and time to repair the small disruption to one part of finance. Instead, you are dealing with a massive, global, systemic blockage that requires that the bad debts be resolved in the only way bad debts can be resolved in a capitalist, free market economy  bankruptcy, reorganization, re-capitalization and re-privatization. Nothing can make the bad debts good. The longer the creditors hold on to false hopes and insist that the debts are good, the longer the stalemate poisons trust and strangles the financial system. Some harm now is much better that growing harm to more and more innocent parties for a decade or more.\tThere is the perception and perhaps the reality that Summers and Geithner are primarily concerned with protecting the system that they have worked with and benefited from all their lives, instead of recognizing the ways it has grown to be destructive and moving to make it accountable. So long as they are your princi-ple advisors and you are perceived to be subject to their influence, you will not be able to restore faith and trust in time to prevent additional, avoidable pain.\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSincerely,\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJohn Young", "created": "1239735338", "user": "John Y.", "location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"text": "Gee, poor people?

After these successive bubbles have finally burst there is an excess of labor.  Unless we have another bubble there will be a large segment of perpetually unemployed and underemployed people who will drag down wages because they will be willing to work for anything...they have families to support.  As a society becomes more technological fewer people are required to run it.  Added to that is the fact that when a job is outsourced not only that job is lost, but also all of its support jobs.  This means that newer high paying jobs are not being created fast enough to overcome those job losses.  Wages have been dropping because there are more people than jobs, the supply outweighs the demand.  This has been accelerated by the massive amounts of immigration from top to bottom.  Nearly 80% of construction work is now non-union thanks to the illegals.  College graduates are working as telemarketers.  Ph.D's in biotech are only making $40-50K a year if they can find employment due to the HB-1 programs and we all know hpw the billionaire owners of high tech companies bribe out politicians to bring in more foreign workers and drive out American workers.  A society that is losing its middle class is a society that is losing its consumers. Even some liberal economists have written that all of this immigration is unnecessary because the only jobs being created by it are service sector jobs to service the increased population.  Our oily politicians, especially Obama now, talk about making the tough decisions when what they really mean is that their decisions are going to be tough on everyone else.  A genuine tough decision would be to turn down the money from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the high tech companies and agribusiness, etc. and say no more immigration until every American has a decent job.  With a tighter job market there would not be older (over 40)  productive citizens unable to find work.

It has become (whether the Republicans or the Democrats are in charge), a government by the government and for the government...bigger is better is the mantra....\"The reality is a little more complex than stated but somewhat on the money. We live with a history where the government has become the agent of business. It started with the secret meetings in Philadelphia which some Americans think were the start of the American experiment in democracy. The Constitutional Convention was an effort to replace a somewhat (from the participants point of view) dysfunctional Continental Congress.At those secret meetings two crucial principles were embedded into the proposed document. One was the concept of private property rights and the second was slavery. Without the fist, the second does could not exist. The document was so deficient in other areas that a Bill of Rights had to be quickly drafted and attached to quiet the mass of Americans who had to be convinced it was OK.Government for the benefit of people was immediately compromised in many ways that challenged the horror of slavery. These compromises inccluded the exclusion of women as voters along with the vast majority of white men who were not land holders or educated.The rich, George Washington being the richest of the rich, became the first President and his top financial advisor was one of his top former military assistants. This man, Hamilton, then completed the conversion of a government of and by the people to one that leaned, strove and enriched the elite, rich and landed few.By the time of Lincoln, the transformation was almost completed. Ironically, the war to save the union, while fictionally freeing the slaves, consolidated the concentration of wealth of the country into even fewer hands. Most of the economically enriched became so because of government (rail road, homestead act, Indian wars, Civil War no bid contracts) actions, programs, give-a-ways and special legislation. Lincoln spoke the words but his backers made the bucks. The rape of the South after the war, known as Reconstruction was just an additional prize for the taking. The rich victors took the spoils. The 600,000 dead took a box.The Tea Pot Scandels, the multiple wars against Native Americans, Spain, WWI, WWII, the Korean Conflict, Cold War, Viet Nam, a host of CIA led secret wars, Panama, Grenada, etc. have just consolidated the hold of the1%-ers who now own over 35% of the total wealth of America and the next 19% who own another 50%.The recent Iraq and Afghanistan Wars show how simple this technique is to implement. The rich through their government proxies declare who is today's eenemy, America goes to war, young people die, all criticism of the government is attacked as being unpatriotic and the redistribution of the nation's wealth flows from the vast taxpayer base to the select few.The mechanism for the transfer of wealth to the rich is government as the transmission belt. Those in government are there to ensure that the belt is well oiled, works and goes unchallenged. Once the government apparaticks are out of government, they go to the rich for their next resume addition. Throughout the whole process, they get richer because they made it possible for their real bosses to get even richer.If Enron, Mad-off, Blag-o (only offense/crime so far has been letting the cat out of the bag of how Americans are being screwed by their elected representatives), Spitzer, AIG, Wall Streeters,Clinton[s], Bruno, Stevenson, etc. do not make this clear, then look at who are all the advisors to Obama  the same crowd of experts found in government under Clinton. The same crwod that already forgot about YOU!Where are the people committees, the average Joe advisors, the Main Streeters who are going to get another dose of pain, lose their homes, cars, jobs, medical insurance, etc in our government? The people speaking for them in government either made millions, failed to pay taxes, live better than most, and have nothing to fear. They, in the beginning and end make sure that their real bosses get a free ride without the pain.So do not think that we lost something recently.

Deflation was the devil that caused the depression  not the collapse in the stock market. The Hoover administration left the economy to its own devices and by the time the government did anything it was too late.If one looks at the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index they are flat or declining. The spike in oil prices last year caused inflationary pressures, which are now easing. Prices are declining with energy leading the way.As consumers have cut back spending, because of unemployment or fears of unemplo0yment, this cut back is starting to be reflected in prices. Therefore, deflation has already taken hold, but just barely.YEs, printing trillions of dollars of money should in norm al terms cause inflation. But, this is not normal times. The economy is on life support, the TARP only stabilized the financial system (kept it from total collapse) and the stimulus bill may or may not have any affect. The states are taking money to fill budget holds, taxpayers are taking their tax refunds and \"Making Work Pay\" credits and either stashing this away or paying down debt. But, if retail sales are indication, people and companies are only buying necessities.President Obama is right about the pain aspect of the near future. The depth of the recession has not be reached yet. Job losses are going to increase for the near term. Companies and consumers will scale back spending until such time they see the economy improving. Unfortunately, for President Obama, the Democrats, the Republicans, the federal reserve, economic advisers, etc.  this country is in uncharted territory. Our economy is totally service based and consumer driven, which limits a recovery. Our economy is no longer diverse as it once was, because much of the diversity has gone off shore.Creating a new economy based upon energy is going to take a long time. In the meantime, the pain is going to be long and it is going to be hard. While we won't reach Great Depression levels  it is still not going to be an easy time. The main problem is all of this is gaining trust. Right now, the average American taxpayer does not trust the financial system, the banks, the government (local, state and federal), and their employers. This trust was not lost overnight, but over the past 30 years. The \"greed factor\" just took over all aspects of society and now society is at the wake up call.At this time, we need a good speaker like President Obama just to help build the confidence and trust. The damage creating this problem took nearly three decades to create and it will not be solved in a matter of days, weeks, or months  but, years.

Wall Street used \"free markets\" as an excuse to ride rough shod over main street.  It is time to let main street labor compete with wall street.  Relax the protectionist policies for capital, namely copyright and patent laws, so Americans can use their labor without fear of lawyers.Also stop subsidizing foreign education, foreign business and tax breaks for globalization.  The main reasons I can assume they do this is they want to project American capitalism into other nations and gain political power. Also stop subsidizing, welfare for the rich, on Wall Street.", "created": "1239756490", "user": "Emanuel", "location": "Paine"}, {"text": "For 30 yrs now we have worked very hard at undermining the foundation of what should be a sound economy.
