The alternative is despair and the desperate hope of wanting to live in a past that was a brighter place than the present. I am a fifth generation Michigander and I grew up in Willow Run, Michigan, about a mile from a GM plant that once employed 50,000 UAW workers in three shifts. Today, this plant employs 1500. And when I go home to visit-as I did last summer-I see the ruins everywhere of what was once a vibrant blue collar town. Anyone who wants to get a better sense for this should take a look at \"The Ruins of Detroit,\" an online photo tour of the fallen monuments of the former industrial metropolis. There are very few people in those pictures, but they are never far from my mind-the people who once worked in the factories and could afford homes, cars, boats, and even cottages on the lake, all bought with hard work. I know all about that good life because the neighborhood I grew up in was filled with UAW members who had enough, but, really, not too much. I realize those days are gone, but I have no idea what comes next and I dont think most Michiganders do either. Today, my husband and I cant find work in Michigan; were among the thousands who have had to move somewhere else. It makes me sad to have to live so far away from my roots. In the summer, when I visit my great-great grandfathers grave in an overgrown rural cemetery or drive by the lake where my grandfather used to go fishing or the closed bowling lanes where my father and his brothers used to bowl, I wonder what the future will bring for those who have stayed behind. Last week, a friend told me that 46,000 people left Michigan last year - or maybe it was last month - I cant remember. If GM and Chrysler go bankrupt, maybe Michigan will become a kind of giant ghost town, surrounded by the bustling beaches of the Great Lakes. It is a vision that keeps me awake nights. Places shouldnt be expendable, nor the people who live in them. How sad are the places where people are trapped after the jobs have moved on; people become like the flotsam and jetsam left behind when the tide goes out.

Employees lost the ability to recover for pain and suffering, but gained the right to swift and fair benefits while recovering from an occupational injury.For many years, the operation of the system was observed to have a built-in bias in favor of injured workers, which would seem rational given they had been deprived of their legal right to bring civil suit.  Indeed, the Court of Appeals at the dawn of the nascent system observed \"The law has been and should be construed fairly, indeed liberally, in favor of the employe[e].\"In recent times, injured workers have been viewed as a drain on competitiveness, and the observations of the Court of Appeals are now a faint echo.  The bargain has been seemingly forgotten, and statutory construction in favor of injured workers has all but disappeared.    Concepts of fault have eased their way insidiously into the system.  For example,  injured workers are denied benefits because -- although they may be disabled -- they are \"not looking hard enough for work.\"  Anti-fraud provisions are venomously applied to charge workers with fraud when they are unable to recall minute details of past medical history under questioning by insurance attorneys armed with reams of past medical records dating to childhood.Likewise, although the drafters and courts may have envisioned a \"streamlined\" resolution process, we see today a highly adversarial, slow-moving and complex system.  However well-intentioned, recent legal and regulatory reforms have only served to make a dysfunctional system worse.  As examples:* Prior to the mid-1990s, the Board staffed physicians who would examine injured workers immediately prior to hearings to provide an independent assessment of disability that carried great weight.  These physicians resolved the contentious and ongoing issue of an individuals \"degree of disability,\" and level of payments.  These physicians were eliminated as a cost-cutting measure, and today every disagreement regarding degree of disability potentially results in an expensive and time-consuming trial pitting the testimony of attending physicians against insurance carrier \"independent\" examiners.* Injured workers rely on reports from their attending physician to prove their claim.  For a nominal per-visit fee, such physicians are expected not only to treat the worker, but to provide a written expert opinion.  For many years, a simple one-page form filed by the physician satisfied this reporting requirement.  Under recent reforms, physicians are now asked to complete one of a half-dozen forms from 2 to 4 pages long with every visit.* Testimony of medical witnesses, often required, does not take place before a Law Judge but is obtained by deposition outside of the hearing process.  This places further demand on physicians and adds cost and delay to process.In the end, the system continues to move further from its intended goals.  Before enacting the next series of \"great leaps forward\" for the system, I propose that legislators and administrators take pause and consider whether their reforms advance or hinder the principles of the original \"bargain.\"  Yes, caring for the injured may extract a price from business, but these are the costs of operating in a compassionate society that does not discard its human wreckage.To borrow an old axiom, policymakers have a choice in shaping the workers compensation system.  Quick, fair, and cheap:  Pick any two.I do take issue with your portrayal of workers compensation attorneys in your article.  Many of us are not -- as is implied --  incompetent, unsophisticated bottom-feeders attracted to practice by short work hours.

The March of Dimes developed a \"team\" approach to care of victims of polio more than 60 years ago. The team included direct care expertise and the doctor was only one of those members of the team. Cystic Fibrosis is another multi-organ involved disorder with a life span continuum that crosses the boundaries of Pediatrics and Internal Medicine. A team approach was modeled upon the March of Dimes polio experience and continues in many CF Centers around the world. The key of course has been the incorporation and respectful \"working together\" of team members focused upon what was in the patients best interest. Over the years, through annual multi-discipline conferences patient care guidelines were developed and REVISED annually based upon newer information and benchmark patient care outcome markers, eventually made public. The major limitations to this style of care for geriatric patients are: internal medicine specialty does not train internists to work in teams where the physician is  just one of several making patient care decisions collaboratively; the teams are more responsible for \"primary care\" health issues as primary care overlaps the teams focus; the patients primary care physicians are not versed in the complexity of the patients problems and tends to defer to the team; the time, and time is money, necessary to address at one sitting many of the health issues frequently get truncated by insurance companies unwilling to think outside of the silos they have built on specific health/specific diseases instead of a wholistic approach and pay for such care; and patients themselves dont want to sit around waiting for one provider after another to come in and see them during a \"clinic\" visit. There are already successful models of multidisciplinary care that are applicable to geriatric care. The physician does not have to be the expert in everything, but the care giver who is the expert in a specific area, has to see each patient, each and every clinic visit. The outcomes can be measured, the costs can be tabulated, and the patient/family can be educated each and every visit; ultimately, patient/family satisfaction will be high. Its been done in the past.

I simply followed the advice given by the CDE (certified diabetes educators) and watched my portions. With portion control and regular exercise, my weight slowly changed for the better. I went from 186 pounds to under 130. I do tai chi, water fitness and try to get in a Silver Sneaker class when I can. I also do a lot of walking. Besides my family doctor, I see a medical oncologist, a pain specialist, cardiologist, pulmonary specialist, podiatrist, GYN, and other specialists as needed. Every doctor is contact with the other; I make sure my medical records are complete and up-to-date so that every physician treating me knows whats happening in the other areas of my health care. When I see my cardiologist, he always asks about my cancer treatments. When I see my family doctor, he reviews reports from my oncologist, etc. Im not saying my life is simple and Im not crazy about all this stuff -- I never expected to have so many doctors, etc. in my life at my age.

For those who dont understand, most physicians are paid according to some version of the RBRVS, which stands for resource based relative value scale.  Medicare pioneered this methodology after it implemented the hospital prospective payment system.The notion that a physician fee schedule should incorporate value inputs is not itself flawed, but the way it was implemented has skewed reimbursement towards an interventionist mindset, even in specialties such as cardiology and radiology that have traditionally not engaged in invasive procedures.The Medicare RBRVS rewards intervention, which, along with a fee for service payment system, financially incentivizes doctors to do more, and more invasive, procedures.  Doctors in training in turn are choosing those specialties that provide greater compensation, such that many people, insured and uninsured alike, now have great difficulty finding primary care physicians.The basic flaw in this system is that it defines value solely by reference to the resources a physician puts into a service, and makes no judgment about what kinds of value that we, consumers, patients, government health care programs, want to extract from physician services.  Hence, the cardiac surgeon gets paid many dollars for his last ditch efforts to save a really sick person -- while the efforts of a PCP to keep another person from reaching such a dire level of need are barely paid for.Ironically, many PCPs have moved to \"concierge medicine\" which is a fancy way of saying that they are paid a capitation for providing a specified level of services to each of their patients, including but sometimes not limited to diagnosing and managing the patients illness.  There is no reason why Medicare (or other payers) could not incorporate some version of this system.  HMOs traditionally did this for PCPs; Kaiser still does.  Sufficiency of payment is an issue, of course, but the bottom line is that payment arrangements need to reflect what we who pay for medical care want to get out of it.

Aside from the possible adverse gastric effects from the medication, there is a high probability that the medication could put this person into severe renal failure. In a person with potentially comprimised renal function such as one sees in the elderly, especially those people with diabetes, the possiblility of precipitating renal failure is quite high. That is one medication I would remove from the profile. Once the naproxen is gone, we could probably then eliminate the omeprazole. The patients drug list has now gone from 13 to 11. While this represents a lot of drugs, it is somewhat more manageable than 13.

I recall some $260,000 per job when all the state and local concessions are factored in. If the auto industry represents a million jobs, and including the peripheral and supply companies this number may be low, to recreate this number of jobs at $260K each would come to $260,000,000,000. Its probably cheaper to save the industry. We also read that \"The real problem is the product. The cars are not good enough. . . . The reputation is fatally damaged.\" Which simply is not true. Quality-rating services and magazine reviews show G.M. autos to be at or near par with comparable foreign makes.

Gas is cheap, so guzzlers are back in. The mindset of many, including my daughters, is that larger is safer. The highways are choked with 18-wheelers and SUVs, leaving the family in the mouse car both cramped and wondering if theyre safe. Hybrids are better than most people realize (at least my Prius is), but theyre falling out of favor because theyre a bit small (5-passenger/4-door, small trunk) for family travel or carting stuff with a couple of kids onboard. First-50-mile all-electric hybrids are on the way, but not here yet. They should arrive just in time for higher gas prices (through fuel tax if necessary) and when the economy is improving.

Other than death and distances through the universe, nothing is forever, and many dispute even the first half of this proposition.There is so much that could be done. G.M. could be retooled -- World War II style -- into the needed build-out of mass/rapid transit. Laws demanding higher gas mileage and retiring polluting stinkers could be put on the books.

It is interesting to note that USA had a hand in the creation of Taliban! In fact Taliban were created by USA, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to fight the Soviet Union in Afghanistan after the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 by the Soviet Union. Each of these three countries  had its own purpose in the creation of Taliban: USA wanted to use Islam to combat USSR and to create an Islamic movement hostile to Iran and its islamic revolution;  Pakistan wanted to control Afghanistan  through Taliban and use them also against India in Kashmir and elsewhere; Saudis (and United Arab Emirates) wanted to propagate Wahhabism so as to counter  Iranian influence and assume leadership of the Islamic world.  So USA became  an ally in this alliance who created and promoted Taliban and Wahhabism in the region (there were other resistance movements in Afghanistan fighting USSR who were not Taliban/Wahhabi).<br />Finally with the help of US weapons (especially deadly Stinger missiles), Pakistani military bases and Saudi money and propaganda, USSR was defeated and Taliban overran most of other resistance movements and came to power in Afghanistan. The only countries who recognized Taliban regime in Afghanistan were: Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates.

This strand of Islam is being promoted and propagated all over the world (including among Muslims in Western countries) by Saudi Arabia and to a lesser extent by  United Arab Emirates through their huge petrodollars. Here again the Arab game is to counter Iran and take the leadership of Islam by propagating Wahhabism. Western countries also have not seen Wahhabism as a menace but  as a useful tool against Iranian/Shiite influence . West now is seeing the catastrophic results of this strategic blunder.The most important danger to the the  middle eastern (including Israel) and Islamic countries is Wahhabism that is promoted by Saudi Arabian princes and their money. Wahhabism is creating terrorist minded ignorant Muslims. If not stopped, this will at the end result in Talibanisation of Muslims. This is a real menace.
